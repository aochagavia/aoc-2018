Time: 16:47 (9:12 + 7:35)

This time I found part 2 easiest, as the instructions were very clear and the logic straightforward.
Part 1 gave me a bit more trouble (as you can see from the timings), since it requires additional
logic to handle edge cases (e.g. words with multiple letters repeated twice, like `aabb`).
