Time: n/a (worked on this on different moments throughout the day)

At first I was a bit scared when I read the puzzle text, because dealing with an infinite map
sounded complex. Fortunately, after some minutes I figured out it would be enough to have a
bounding box around the input coordinates. From this perspective, any region that touches the border
is infinite. The rest was conceptually trivial, but it took me a surprising amount of time to
implement due to difficult to track logic bugs in my code.

Part 2 was easy and I finished it much quicker.
