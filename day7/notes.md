Time: 82 minutes (20 + 62)

Like other times, at first I thought I needed to use a graph algorithm. However, it turned
out to be unnecessary. Writing code to find the next part of the sleigh was easy. Put that
inside a for loop and you are done! Part two was tricky, though, as you can see from the
timings above...
